                Hey! My Name is Shea Wilson and I was born and raised in south Florida, Lauderhill to be exact. I served
                twelve years in the United States Marine Corps, where I got to see portions of the world I wouldn't have been 
                able to see otherwise. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science Information Systems I'm married to 
                a beautiful woman and we have a beautiful daughter who was born April of this year(2023). I'm very much into 
                lifting weights, gaming, and coding.
